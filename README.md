About Me

Hi, I’m Miraya.

A self-taught developer based in Germany. I design and build whatever I can imagine.

I was born in Sweden and moved to Germany when I was 13.

At 17, I dropped out of high school, and opened a tattoo studio and ran it for a year, until COVID forced me to pivot. That’s when I discovered coding.

At 18, I taught myself frontend development. 6 months later, I landed my first full-time dev job. Since then, I’ve built over 100 public GitHub projects and probably double that in private.

My current stack → react, typescript and tailwind.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

Fun Facts:

I have two cats
I don’t like coffee or tea
Demon Slayer is my favorite anime
Hobbies: gym, anime, building things
